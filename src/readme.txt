
Lawn Mower test, Ze'ev Goshen
-----------------------------

1) Run "node index" at the project root.
2) The data file is "data_file.txt" at the root folder of the project.
3) No third party lbs used. 
4) Tests - run tests with: "node test" at root of project. Writing tests for complete coverage is very time consuming.
5) DataObject.cs is where the data gets parsed according to the meaning of each line of text from the data file.
6) CoreFunctions.js has general functionality that can be inherited, in our case, by LawnMower.js.
    (The idea is that other machines with similar motion capabilities would be able to reuse basic functionality).
7)
